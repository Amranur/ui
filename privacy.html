                        <p>The CCPA provides California residents with specific rights regarding their Personal Data.
                            This section applies only to users that are California residents, describes the rights under
                            the CCPA and explains how to exercise those rights. This section does not apply to our
                            handling of publicly available information from government records, de-identified or
                            aggregated information or other information that is excluded from the CCPA&#x27;s scope. The
                            term &quot;Personal Information&quot; shall have the meaning ascribed to it under the CCPA.
                        </p>

                            collect sensitive Personal Information. The table also lists, for each category, the source
                            of the Personal Information, the business purposes for which it will be processed and the
                            third parties to whom it may be disclosed. This section describes our current practices and
                            our practices during the 12 months preceding the &quot;Last Updated&quot; date of this
