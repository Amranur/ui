                            payment of all applicable Fees, Tavily hereby grants you a limited, revocable,
                            non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license for the duration of this
                            Agreement to utilize the Tavily Search API Services for the following purposes: (i) to
                            employ the API exclusively for internal development of Applications designed to interact and
                            function with the Tavily.com offerings; (ii) to engage with the API; and (iii) with
                            Tavily&#x27;s explicit prior consent, to exhibit certain Tavily Marks in accordance with any

                            of the API and the Applications, and not in connection with the marketing, promotion,
                            distribution, or sale of any other goods or services. The API Materials are permitted for
                            use in responding to inquiries on your website, but not for training artificial intelligence

                        <h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
                        <p>As a user of the Tavily Search API, you bear full responsibility and liability for all
                            activities conducted through your access to the API, whether such activities are authorized
                            by you or are in breach of this Agreement. This includes the conduct of any end users
                            interacting with your Application and their use of the API. Any violation of this Agreement
                            by an end user shall be considered a violation by you. You are obliged to inform your end
                            users of the terms of this Agreement that are relevant to their use of the API and to ensure
                            their compliance with these terms.</p>
                        <p>To access and use the Tavily Search API, you must secure an API Key from tavily.com. This API
                            Key is for your use only and must not be shared with third parties. You are required to
                            safeguard your API Key and any associated login credentials. The API Key is your exclusive
                            credential for API access, and Tavily reserves the right to revoke it at any time. Should
                            there be any unauthorized use of your API Key, you must promptly notify Tavily via
                            support@tavily.com as outlined in the Notice provision of this Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Your use of the Tavily Search API must adhere to all applicable laws, regulations, and this
                            Agreement&#x27;s terms. Additionally, you must follow any guidelines or requirements posted
                            by Tavily on the tavily.com website, in documentation, or communicated in other ways. You
                            are tasked with monitoring Application usage to prevent and address any illegal or
                            inappropriate activities, including taking action against users who violate these terms. It
                            is your responsibility to provide necessary privacy notices and obtain consents from end
                            users as required by law for their use of the Application.</p>
                        <p>The Tavily Search API must not be used to support, promote, or engage in illegal activities,
                            including but not limited to the distribution of malware, counterfeit goods, embargoed
                            items, spam emails, pyramid schemes, hate content, hacking tools, or any products or
                            services that are illegal or unethical.</p>
                        <p>You are expected to protect the API and any related materials (including all copies thereof)
                            from infringement, misappropriation, or unauthorized access using commercially reasonable
                            efforts. Should you become aware of any infringement of intellectual property rights related
                            to the API, you are to notify Tavily immediately and cooperate fully in any protective legal
                            actions.</p>
                        <p>In any product that incorporates the Tavily Search API, you may use the phrase “POWERED BY
                            Tavily” to acknowledge the underlying technology. Tavily reserves the right to oversee your
                            use of the Tavily Marks on your site, which may include requiring changes to the display of
                            these marks or revoking your permission to use them, in accordance with Tavily&#x27;s
                            guidelines. Your use of the Tavily Marks does not confer any ownership or rights to you, and
                            all associated goodwill will benefit Tavily. You must not imply a partnership, sponsorship,
                            or endorsement by Tavily without express written consent from Tavily, which may be given or
                            withheld at Tavily&#x27;s discretion. Unless otherwise agreed, Tavily may use your company
                            or product name, screenshots, or other depictions of your Application for marketing or
                            demonstrating the API.</p>
                        <h2>Updates</h2>
                        <p>Throughout the duration of this Agreement, Tavily may supply modifications or enhancements to
                            the Tavily Search API (collectively, &quot;Modifications&quot;), which shall be included
                            under the API&#x27;s terms and conditions. You acknowledge that Tavily may mandate the
                            adoption of the most current version of the Tavily Search API. Such Modifications may change
                            the way Applications interact with Tavily&#x27;s offerings. It is your responsibility to
                            implement any necessary adjustments to the Applications for continued compatibility
                            following such Modifications, at your own expense. Tavily will strive to provide you with
                            reasonable advance notice of significant changes or Modifications. Your continued
                            utilization of the Tavily Search API post-Modification signifies your acceptance of the
                            Modification.</p>
                        <h2>Pricing and Payment Terms</h2>
                        <h3>Pricing Structure and Subscription Terms</h3>
                        <p>You agree to compensate Tavily for services rendered as per the pricing (&quot;Pricing&quot;)
                            listed on tavily.com. Pricing is payable upfront for the specified subscription period.
                            Certain Pricing plans may include a quota of API call credits. Payments can be processed
                            through the electronic methods available on tavily.com. API call credits acquired but not
                            utilized within the subscription period may be retained and used by you for up to one year
                            following the agreement&#x27;s termination. These credits are neither transferable nor
                            refundable. Post-termination use of credits is governed by the terms of this Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Tavily reserves the right to modify its Pricing with a notice period of 60 days. All
                            transactions, including deposits and purchases, are final and non-refundable. Payments must
                            be made in U.S. dollars by the due date, via methods specified by Tavily. Except as
                            explicitly stated in this Agreement or as mandated by law, all payments are non-refundable.
                            Failure to remit payment on time may result in Tavily imposing an interest charge on the
                            overdue amount at a monthly rate of 1.5%, calculated daily and compounded monthly, or the
                            maximum rate allowable by law, whichever is lower. You will also be responsible for
                            reimbursing Tavily for all expenses incurred in collecting overdue payments or interest,
                            including legal fees, court costs, and collection agency fees. Tavily may, at its
                            discretion, restrict or suspend your access to the Tavily Search API, its offerings,
                            content, and any other services until all arrears and interest are settled. Such suspension
                            or restriction does not obligate Tavily to you or any third party. Alternatively, Tavily may
                            exercise any other rights under this Agreement, including termination.</p>
                        <h3>Tax Responsibilities</h3>
                        <p>All Pricing and other amounts due under this Agreement do not include taxes or similar
                            levies. You are liable for all sales, use, excise taxes, and any other similar taxes,
                            duties, and charges imposed by any federal, state, or local governmental entity on the
                            amounts payable under this Agreement, excluding taxes levied on Tavily&#x27;s income. Should
                            you be required to withhold taxes on payments to Tavily, you may deduct such taxes from the
                            owed amount and remit them to the appropriate tax authority. You must promptly obtain and
                            provide Tavily with an official receipt for such withholdings and any other documentation
                            Tavily reasonably requests to claim a foreign tax credit or refund. It is your duty to
                            ensure that any withheld taxes are minimized as much as possible under applicable law.</p>
                        <h2>Collection and Utilization of Information</h2>
                        <h3>Data Gathering</h3>

                            that there may be occasions when access is disrupted due to technical issues or unforeseen
                            circumstances beyond our control. Tavily shall not be liable for disruptions caused by
                            network or power failures. We reserve the right to temporarily interrupt, suspend, or modify

                        <h3>Indemnification</h3>
                        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Tavily and its affiliates against any claims or
                            liabilities arising from your use of the API, Tavily offerings, content, or trademarks, or
                            any breach of this Agreement. Should Tavily require indemnification, we will notify you
                            promptly. Tavily reserves the right to assume control of the defense with counsel of our
                            choice, and you may not settle any claim without Tavily&#x27;s written consent.</p>
                        <h3>Liability Limitation</h3>
                        <p>Under no circumstances will Tavily be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, or
                            consequential damages arising from the use of the API or services. Tavily&#x27;s total
                            liability will not exceed the fees you have paid to Tavily in the 12 months preceding the
                            claim. Any claims must be brought within three months of the event giving rise to such
                            claim.</p>
                        <h2>Duration and Cessation</h2>
                        <h3>Duration</h3>
                        <p>The duration of this Agreement commences once the Licensee acknowledges acceptance and
                            remains in effect until terminated as provided herein.</p>
                        <h3>Suspension</h3>

                        <h3>Termination</h3>
                        <p>Subscriptions will persist until terminated. The Licensee may terminate this Agreement at any
                            time by notifying Tavily.com, such as through a request to cancel the subscription via
                            account settings. Tavily.com retains the authority to terminate any subscription at any
                            time, with or without notice to the Licensee, for any reason or no reason, at its sole
                            discretion.</p>
                        <h3>Consequences of Expiration or Termination</h3>

                            trademarks from all devices and systems under their direct or indirect control. All pending
                            payments, if applicable, will immediately become due and payable.</p>
                        <h3>Continuation</h3>
                        <p>Provisions that, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination or
                            expiration of this Agreement, including but not limited to Sections regarding
                            indemnification, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability, will continue to be
                            enforceable post-termination.</p>
                        <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
                        <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
                        <p>This Agreement, along with any documents referenced herein and incorporated by reference,
                            represents the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the Parties
                            regarding the Tavily Search API, and supersedes all prior negotiations, agreements, and
                            understandings, both oral and written. In the case of any discrepancies between the main
                            body of this Agreement and any incorporated documents, the provisions of this Agreement
                            shall take precedence.</p>
                        <h3>Remedies for Breach</h3>
                        <p>The Parties acknowledge that monetary damages may be insufficient to remedy any breach of
                            this Agreement by the user, particularly with respect to Sections 2 and 3, and that
                            Tavily.com shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief to prevent or remedy any breaches or
                            threatened breaches. In the event of such a breach, Tavily.com is authorized to seek all
                            equitable remedies available, without the need for posting bond or proving actual damages.
                            The user hereby waives any argument that Tavily.com has an adequate remedy at law.</p>
                        <h3>Force Majeure</h3>
                        <p>Tavily.com shall not be held responsible for delays or non-performance of its obligations
                            under this Agreement due to events beyond its reasonable control. Tavily.com commits to
                            resuming performance promptly once the condition is resolved.</p>
                        <h3>Independent Contractors</h3>
                        <p>The relationship between Tavily.com and the user is that of independent contractors. This
                            Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, or agency relationship
                            between them.</p>
                        <h3>Notices</h3>
                        <p>All notices under this Agreement must be in writing. Notices to Tavily.com should be sent to
                            support@tavily.com. Tavily.com will send notices to users at the email address associated
                            with their Tavily Search API account. Notices are deemed effective upon receipt, provided
                            that the sending party can demonstrate that the notice was sent according to this section.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Amendments and Waivers</h3>
                        <p>No changes to this Agreement are binding unless made in writing and signed by both parties. A
                            waiver of any term or condition must also be in writing and signed by the party granting the
                            waiver. Failure to exercise any right under this Agreement does not constitute a waiver of
                            that right.</p>
                        <h3>Severability</h3>
                        <p>Should any provision of this Agreement be found unenforceable or invalid, such finding does
                            not affect the remainder of the Agreement. The Parties will negotiate in good faith to
                            replace any such provision with a valid one that reflects the original intent as closely as
                            possible.</p>
                        <h3>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
                        <p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York, excluding any conflict of
                            laws principles. The United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods does not
                            apply. Any disputes will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts located in

                        <h3>Assignment</h3>
                        <p>The user may not assign this Agreement or any rights hereunder without the prior written
                            consent of Tavily.com. Any unauthorized assignment is null and void. Tavily.com may assign
