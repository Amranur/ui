This includes the conduct of any end users interacting with your Application and their use of the API. Any violation of this Agreement by an end user shall be considered a violation by you. You are obliged to inform your end users of the terms of this Agreement that are relevant to their use of the API and to ensure their compliance with these terms.\n\nTo access and use the Tavily Search API, you must secure an API Key from tavily.com. This API Key is for your use only and must not be shared with third parties. You are required to safeguard your API Key and any associated login credentials. The API Key is your exclusive credential for API access, and Tavily reserves the right to revoke it at any time. Should there be any unauthorized use of your API Key, you must promptly notify Tavily via support@tavily.com as outlined in the Notice provision of this Agreement.\n\nYour use of the Tavily Search API must adhere to all applicable laws, regulations, and this Agreement\'s terms. Additionally, you must follow any guidelines or requirements posted by Tavily on the tavily.com website, in documentation, or communicated in other ways. You are tasked with monitoring Application usage to prevent and address any illegal or inappropriate activities, including taking action against users who violate these terms. It is your responsibility to provide necessary privacy notices and obtain consents from end users as required by law for their use of the Application.\n\nThe Tavily Search API must not be used to support, promote, or engage in illegal activities, including but not limited to the distribution of malware, counterfeit goods, embargoed items, spam emails, pyramid schemes, hate content, hacking tools, or any products or services that are illegal or unethical.\n\nYou are expected to protect the API and any related materials (including all copies thereof) from infringement, misappropriation, or unauthorized access using commercially reasonable efforts. Should you become aware of any infringement of intellectual property rights related to the API, you are to notify Tavily immediately and cooperate fully in any protective legal actions.\n\nIn any product that incorporates the Tavily Search API, you may use the phrase “POWERED BY Tavily” to acknowledge the underlying technology. Tavily reserves the right to oversee your use of the Tavily Marks on your site, which may include requiring changes to the display of these marks or revoking your permission to use them, in accordance with Tavily\'s guidelines. Your use of the Tavily Marks does not confer any ownership or rights to you, and all associated goodwill will benefit Tavily. You must not imply a partnership, sponsorship, or endorsement by Tavily without express written consent from Tavily, which may be given or withheld at Tavily\'s discretion. Unless otherwise agreed, Tavily may use your company or product name, screenshots, or other depictions of your Application for marketing or demonstrating the API.\n\n## Updates\nThroughout the duration of this Agreement, Tavily may supply modifications or enhancements to the Tavily Search API (collectively, "Modifications"), which shall be included under the API\'s terms and conditions. You acknowledge that Tavily may mandate the adoption of the most current version of the Tavily Search API. Such Modifications may change the way Applications interact with Tavily\'s offerings. It is your responsibility to implement any necessary adjustments to the Applications for continued compatibility following such Modifications, at your own expense. Tavily will strive to provide you with reasonable advance notice of significant changes or Modifications. Your continued utilization of the Tavily Search API post-Modification signifies your acceptance of the Modification.\n\n## Pricing and Payment Terms\n### Pricing Structure and Subscription Terms\nYou agree to compensate Tavily for services rendered as per the pricing ("Pricing") listed on tavily.com. Pricing is payable upfront for the specified subscription period. Certain Pricing plans may include a quota of API call credits. Payments can be processed through the electronic methods available on tavily.com. API call credits acquired but not utilized within the subscription period may be retained and used by you for up to one year following the agreement\'s termination. These credits are neither transferable nor refundable. Post-termination use of credits is governed by the terms of this Agreement.\n\nTavily reserves the right to modify its Pricing with a notice period of 60 days. All transactions, including deposits and purchases, are final and non-refundable. Payments must be made in U.S. dollars by the due date, via methods specified by Tavily. Except as explicitly stated in this Agreement or as mandated by law, all payments are non-refundable. Failure to remit payment on time may result in Tavily imposing an interest charge on the overdue amount at a monthly rate of 1.5%, calculated daily and compounded monthly, or the maximum rate allowable by law, whichever is lower. You will also be responsible for reimbursing Tavily for all expenses incurred in collecting overdue payments or interest, including legal fees, court costs, and collection agency fees. Tavily may, at its discretion, restrict or suspend your access to the Tavily Search API, its offerings, content, and any other services until all arrears and interest are settled. Such suspension or restriction does not obligate Tavily to you or any third party. Alternatively, Tavily may exercise any other rights under this Agreement, including termination.\n\n### Tax Responsibilities\nAll Pricing and other amounts due under this Agreement do not include taxes or similar levies. You are liable for all sales, use, excise taxes, and any other similar taxes, duties, and charges imposed by any federal, state, or local governmental entity on the amounts payable under this Agreement, excluding taxes levied on Tavily\'s income. Should you be required to withhold taxes on payments to Tavily, you may deduct such taxes from the owed amount and remit them to the appropriate tax authority. You must promptly obtain and provide Tavily with an official receipt for such withholdings and any other documentation Tavily reasonably requests to claim a foreign tax credit or refund. It is your duty to ensure that any withheld taxes are minimized as much as possible under applicable law.\n\n## Collection and Utilization of Information\n### Data Gathering\nTavily Search API may gather certain data through the API or the Tavily.com offerings about you or your representatives, including employees, contractors, or agents.
